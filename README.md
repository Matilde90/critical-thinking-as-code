# Critical Thinking as Code

Critical thinking as code is a linter for reasoning. It will help engineers to make reasoning explicit, and encourage robust reasoning.
It will let you codify arguments as structured data and it will give instant and transparent feedback on potential weak reasoning patterns:

- Missing premises
- Circular reasoning
- Vagueness/hedging
- Overgeneralization
- Modality-confidence mismatch
